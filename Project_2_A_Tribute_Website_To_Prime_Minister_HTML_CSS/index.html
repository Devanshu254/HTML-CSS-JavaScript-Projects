          <h2>Indian Best Prime Minister</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Mr. Narendra Damodardas Modi</b> is the present and 15th Indian
            prime minister. He has been serving our nation since 26th May 2014.
            From the year 2001 to 2014, before taking over Delhi, he served the
            role of Honourable Chief Minister of Gujarat. He is a Member of the
            Parliament (MP), who represents the city of Varanasi. He is the
            leader of the popular Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In the 2014
            general election, BJP, led by Narendra Modi, gained the majority in
            the Lok Sabha. This was the first such major win for a political
            party since 1984. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was born in a
            lower-middle-class family at Vadnagar, Gujarat. He had a keen
            interest in politics since the early days of his childhood. After
            completing his higher education in his hometown, he decided to join
            Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. This is popularly known as RSS in our
            country. During his earlier ages of life, he was headstrong and was
            not that keen on the concept of marriage. Since then, he has
            dedicated his entire life to his motherland. At the age of 17,
            Narendra Modi decided to travel around the country and gain
            knowledge while helping others. Mr Modi is a great admirer of the
            ideologies of Swami Vivekananda. He always emphasizes, "Coming age
            is the age of knowledge. However, rich, poor, or powerful a country
            be, if they want to move ahead, only knowledge can lead them to that
            path."

          <h2>Some Important Points.</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Narendra Modi is a motivation for every Indian. He became the
              prime minister of India after breaking the bar of a
              poverty-stricken tea-selling boy. He has seamlessly become a
              development-oriented leader. Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on
              17th September 1950. He is a prominent figure who showed us
              success is not related to the caste system. It doesnâ€™t matter from
              where a person belongs or what his or her background is.
            </li>
            <li>
              Narendra Modi is considered a master strategist and becomes a ray
              of hope for billions of lives in India. He is one of the leaders
              who stay focused on developments. With him, the dignity of labor
              is respected, and the working class is supported greatly. Narendra
              Modi is the glorious son of Late Damodardas Mulchand Modi and
              Heeraben Damodardas Modi. None of the prime ministers had taken
              office when their mother was alive. It is Mr. Modi who created
              history.
